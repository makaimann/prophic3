# Purpose

This directory contains simple model checking examples with arrays that are not k-inductive.

We hope that an abstraction refinement loop + some prophecy variables can improve model checking of these cases

# Examples

* array.smv: this one is not inductive, but is solved by IC3+IA quickly
