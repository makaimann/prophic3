* Key ideas
** It appears that the counter invariants are very hard to find for IC3
** Thus, I ran some tests that provide the counter invariants
*** We could make the count of the DUT one of the inputs to the Scoreboard
** With the counter invariants, it solves much easier and arrays + prophecy variables really help
   depth 16, datawid 2, arrays and prophecy variables: ~3m
   depth 16, datawid 2, bv only: ~6m
