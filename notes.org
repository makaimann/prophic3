* Key ideas
** It appears that the counter invariants are very hard to find for IC3
** Thus, I ran some tests that provide the counter invariants
*** We could make the count of the DUT one of the inputs to the Scoreboard
** With the counter invariants, it solves much easier and arrays + prophecy variables really help
   depth 16, datawid 2, arrays and prophecy variables: ~3m
   depth 16, datawid 2, bv only: ~6m

* Outstanding Issues
** Do we need history variables?
*** array-int-trans* examples seem to imply we do
*** what happens if it's not a constant delay? Maybe we should then try the ITE encoding -- i.e. might need to keep track of new indices
** How to handle array disequality?
*** Note: we might not be able to handle comparisons between two arrays that started as CONSTARRAY
*** This seems like it requires a quantifier in the assumption
