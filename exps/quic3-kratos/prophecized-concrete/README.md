# Prophecized Concrete Systems

These are concrete versions of the system with auxiliary variables added automatically by ProphIC3.

This was accomplished by running prophic3 and any time auxiliary variables were added to the abstract
system, they are also added to the concrete system. The modified concrete system was dumped at every
step before going to IC3.
