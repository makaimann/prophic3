These benchmarks were generated using SeaHorn to translate C programs with the following options:
--horn-format=pure-smt2 --horn-step=flarge --horn-sem-lvl=mem -horn-unify-assumes -horn-global-constraints -horn-array-global-constraints -horn-sea-dsa

Additionally, I needed to manually edit array_mul_init-true-unreach-call.c to declare the SIZE. However, there still seems to be an issue.
Translating with --horn-format=smt2 vs --horn-format=pure-smt2 gives different results when solving with z3 and neither seems right (because z3 can solve both).

Needs to be looked into more. Consider trying it with addition instead of multiplication to see if it makes a difference.
