Made minor changes to programs

For array_mul_init-true-unreach-call.c
just declared SIZE to be a nondet_int greater than 0

For array_find_first_nonull.c needed to get rid of stdio.h header and use 0 instead of NULL

Errors in vmt translation
sanfoundry_24_true-unreach-call.smt2
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::length_error'
  what():  vector::_M_fill_insert
